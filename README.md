loading screen concept


Idea is that you can run a "vibe" playlist offline on phone or desktop

If internet - can just run playlist with modifications
Else has downloaded files to play through

but would open by default/would be a side panel on mobile

Play rpasij and a random reel from a selection
Play shadowfall and gameness from various images/gifs (like spotify)
Play "boxing" motivation from a selection

- rips video
- can play music through API
- can add clock
- stays on
- lightweight on battery
